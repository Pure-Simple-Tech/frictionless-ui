# frictionless-ui

UI components that are easy to interact with

## About

These components are not intended to be used "as is", but rather to be used as building blocks for your own components.

### TODO

- create build script to create a single css file from all the components
- make export file point to the dist folder (will be created at build time)
- add build stept to "publish" script
- setup pre-commit check (husky?) to make sure all commits follow conventional commits
- make "publish" script auto-increment version based on conventional commits
- add es-lint
- add prettier
- include style and lint checks in "publish" script
- include style and lint checks in pre-commit hook (make sure they only check staged files)
